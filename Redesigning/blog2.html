        <br> Openers venkatesh and ganesh took the score to 33 before being parted,
        <br> whereupon ajith 19 and arun 17* joined forces to take the team home to crucial draw in the final over
        <br> and setting up a likely serious match against immortals at pillars fathers .
        <br> After two very convincing matches as previously reported against districtxi (9 wickets) and mutundxi draw, the squad
        travelled to dhanalakshmi college.
        <br> Game no 3:
        <br> Youngchamps were asked to bat first after stand in skipper ganesh lost the toss.
        <br> An opening stand of 61 between Ganesh and Dilipkumar set Youngchampscc up for a Good total,
        <br> Gopi 20* providing support to vetrivelu who was finally dismissed off the last ball of the innings, his game changed
        for Youngchampscc as a total of 141-4 was recorded from the 20 overs.
        <br> With Immortals wicket keeper Bharath batting superbly at the start of their innings, a shock result took the game
        from us with immortals crushing us with 10 wickets victory. After that,ensuring for qualification for the semi-finals
        looks darker side with one game to spare.
        <br> In between the games, there have been several activities off the field. Some of the squad took part in a ngo meetings
        , badminton , gym to keep themselves with positive vibes .
        <br> Game no 4:
        <br> The day has begun it was a cloudy morning and we the team was travelling once again to the pillar fathers for our
        last group stage and a decider for us to ensure the spot in the semi's. Batting first in the difficult conditions
        younchampscc had a good start with Ganesh 28 and Vetrivelu 36* as soon as middle orders collapsed posting 120-9 on
        the board.
        <br> Our Captain Vetrivelu gave us a encouraging start notes with an aggressive mindset we want on to the field .Wickets
        falling from one end to another end with pacers dilipkumar and prasanth enjoying their spell with 2wkts each.Soon
        the opponent posting a decent partnership of 73 with 4wkts remaining .With 13 of 12 balls captain vetrivelu made
        a brave decision to go with his death bowler arunkumar which turned the match upside down by gaining 3wkts leaving
        1 run .
        <br> And the final over is on with prasanth having ball in his hand with 12 from 6 balls, the reverse swinging yorker
        from the bowler got him bowled and the Young Champs Cricket Club got back to winning ways in a nail biting finish.
        As we climbed to the third spot in Desertstorm League with a win against fellow strugglers Chennaiaces.
        <br> Vetrivelu demonstrated exceptional leadership qualities by delegating responsibilities within the club and, in turn,
        leading the team to the Semifinal spot.
        <br> SEMI FINALS
        <br> On a very hot and sunny morning at the pillarfathers, youngchamps played immortals in the first semifinals. youngchamps
        won the toss and decided to field.
        <br> Bowling first, youngchamps produced a good tight bowling display across all 6 bowlers, with dilipkumar, prasanth
        claiming a wicket apiece, and gopi seven wickets With a run-out too and some tight keeping and fieldingby the youngchamps,
        immortals were restricted to 108 net.
        <br> Unfortunately wickets fell regularly throughout youngchamps reply, with some soft shots and poor defensive technique
        against straight balls on display. More work needed here, as we've lost 3 wickets for 23 runs ! Vetrivelu and Dilipkumar
        both made net positive contributions and Will Gopi continued his batting with an excellent 15 not out. But the game
        was in the balance going to the sixth pair until an excellent 47 undefeated from skipper Vetrivelu guided Youngchamps
        to a narrow victory by 6 wkts.
        <br> Throughout the season the club encountered a number of challenges. During this time Vetrivelu galvanised the playing
        group to keep focussing on the task of making semifinals and eventually making to the Grand Final after making a
        successive defeats.
